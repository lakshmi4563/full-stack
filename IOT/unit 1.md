# **Wireless vs Wired in IoT**

### **1. Characteristics of Wireless Media**

* **Multiple Access Medium** → Unlike wired (where one cable connects two devices), in wireless the medium (air) is **shared by all devices**.
* **Difficult to isolate signals** → Wireless signals spread in all directions, so targeting a single device is not straightforward.
* **Eavesdropping issues** → Since signals are broadcast, anyone nearby can listen unless encryption is applied.
* **Error-prone** → Wireless links suffer from **noise, interference, fading, multipath reflections**.
* **Shared frequency and distance** → Devices must share spectrum (frequency channels) and transmission distance.
* **Collision & multipath** → Signals may collide or arrive at the receiver from multiple paths with delay (causing distortion).

---

### **2. Problems in Wireless Media**

* **Hidden Node Problem**:

  * Suppose Node A and Node C are both within range of Node B, but not within range of each other.
  * If A transmits to B and C also transmits to B at the same time, a **collision** happens at B.
  * Neither A nor C knows about the other → **hidden from each other**.
  * Solution: RTS/CTS (Request to Send / Clear to Send) mechanism in Wi-Fi.

* **Exposed Node Problem**:

  * Suppose Node B is transmitting to A, and Node C wants to transmit to D.
  * Even though B and C are neighbors, C’s transmission to D would not interfere with A.
  * But C **assumes the medium is busy** and waits unnecessarily → reducing efficiency.

# **Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11): Explained**

### **How Wi-Fi Works**

* **Access Point (AP):**

  * Creates a **WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network)**.
  * Connected to a **wired router** via Ethernet.
  * Radiates Wi-Fi signal in a given area.

* **Distribution System (DS):**

  * Connects multiple APs to form a larger network.
  * Example path: Device A → AP-1 → DS → AP-3 → Device F.

* **Channel Allocation:**

  * Each AP works on a different frequency channel than its neighbors.
  * Prevents collisions in overlapping areas.

* **Wireless Router vs Access Point:**

  * A **wireless router** connects wireless stations to the wired network.
  * **APs** extend Wi-Fi coverage but are connected by wired backbone.

* Supports **higher capacity, wider coverage, better performance**.
* Works even in **dense environments** (stadiums, malls, smart cities).
* Designed with **IoT and smart homes** in mind.

---

### **Key Features**

1. **High Device Density Support**

   * **MU-MIMO (Multi-User, Multiple Input Multiple Output):**

     * Lets APs serve multiple devices simultaneously, instead of one-by-one.

2. **Dual Frequency Operation**

   * Works across **2.4 GHz & 5 GHz bands simultaneously**.

3. **Beamforming**

   * Focuses Wi-Fi signals towards a specific device instead of broadcasting everywhere.
   * Improves data rate and power efficiency.
   * Also used in **5G networks**.

4. **Target Wake Time (TWT):**

   * IoT devices can **sleep longer** and wake up at scheduled times.
   * Saves **battery power**, making Wi-Fi 6 IoT-friendly.

## **How UWB Works in IoT**

* **Signal Transmission**:

  * UWB transmitters emit **short pulses (in nanoseconds)** at specific time intervals.
  * These pulses spread across a wide frequency range.

* **Localization**:

  * **Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA)** method:
    Multiple receivers (kept at known fixed positions) capture the pulses.
    By calculating the time difference in arrival, the **exact location of the transmitter (asset)** can be determined.
  * Needs at least:

    * **3 receivers** → for **2D location** (x, y coordinates).
    * **4 receivers** → for **3D location** (x, y, z coordinates).
  * Accuracy: **within a few inches** → very precise compared to Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.

---

## **Applications / Use Cases**

1. **Indoor Localization & Context Awareness**

   * Like GPS for indoor environments.
   * Used in shopping malls, airports, railway stations for navigation.
   * Locating goods in warehouses.
   * Tracking people/objects inside buildings.

2. **Asset Tracking**

   * Attaching UWB tags to devices/assets → locate them with high accuracy.
   * Example: Hospitals (track equipment), logistics (track parcels).

3. **Consumer Electronics**

   * Smartphones use UWB for **digital keys** (e.g., Samsung uses UWB to unlock cars).
   * SmartTags (Samsung) and NXP UWB chips for precise device finding.

4. **Wildlife and Pet Tracking**

   * UWB tags used to track animals and pets with high precision.

5. **Radar & Ranging**

   * Due to nanosecond pulses, UWB provides **superior resolution** in radar-based applications.

Perfect, let’s break this into **two parts**: **NFC (Near Field Communication)** and **RFID (Radio Frequency Identification)**. I’ll explain in detail, include exam-ready points like **range, frequency, duplex, licensing, applications, advantages/disadvantages**, and even compare them because examiners often like that.

# **1. NFC: Near Field Communication**

### **Definition & Purpose**

* **NFC** is a short-range wireless communication technology that enables secure transactions, device pairing, and data sharing.
* It is designed for **very short distances (< 4 cm)** → reduces eavesdropping and makes transactions secure.

### **Working Principle**

* **Frequency**: Operates at **13.56 MHz** in the **unlicensed ISM band**.
* **Technology**: Based on **inductive coupling** (like RFID), where the magnetic field couples two devices close together.
* **NFC devices can act as**:

  * **Electronic ID documents** (like Aadhaar cards, passports).
  * **Keycards** (digital access systems).
  * **Payment devices** (Google Pay, Apple Pay).

### **Modes of NFC**

1. **Card Emulation Mode** → Device acts like a smart card (used for contactless payments, metro cards).
2. **Reader/Writer Mode** → Device reads/writes data from/to passive NFC tags.
3. **Peer-to-Peer Mode** → Two devices exchange data directly (e.g., contact sharing, Bluetooth pairing).

### **NFC Tags**

* Passive data stores.
* Usually small chips embedded in posters, cards, or objects.
* Can be **read-only** or **read-write** depending on the type.

### **Relation to RFID**

* **NFC protocols** are based on **RFID standards** but designed for **very close range + secure interactions**.

---

# **2. RFID: Radio Frequency Identification**

### **Definition & Purpose**

* **RFID** is a technology that uses electromagnetic fields to **identify and track objects** automatically using tags.
* Unlike barcodes, RFID **does not need line of sight** (tag can be embedded inside an object).

### **Components**

* **RFID tag** (transponder): Contains a chip + antenna.
* **Reader**: Sends out radio waves and receives responses.
* **Transponder (tag)**: Responds when it gets the signal.

### **Types of Tags**

1. **Passive Tags**

   * No internal battery.
   * Powered by the reader’s signal.
   * Short range (a few cm to a few meters).
   * Cheap, commonly used.

2. **Active Tags**

   * Contain a battery.
   * Longer range (up to hundreds of meters).
   * More expensive.

### **Frequencies Used**

* **Low Frequency (LF): 125 – 134 kHz** → animal tracking, access control.
* **High Frequency (HF): 13.56 MHz** → similar to NFC, smart cards.
* **Ultra High Frequency (UHF): 860 – 960 MHz** → supply chain tracking, retail.
* **Microwave**: 2.4 GHz, 5.8 GHz → long range, toll collection.

### **Working Principle**

* Tags respond using **backscatter modulation**: they reflect and modulate the reader’s signal to send data back.
* Longer range systems require **higher transmission energy** from the reader.
