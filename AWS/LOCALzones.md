## General FAQs

### What are AWS Local Zones?

Local Zones are extensions of AWS Regions located closer to your end users. They offer core AWS services—like compute and storage—with **very low latency**, connected to the parent Region via AWS's high-bandwidth private network. ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][2])

### When should I use Local Zones?

Great for:

* Low-latency applications (e.g., gaming, real-time media).
* Hybrid deployments requiring synergy between on-premises and cloud.
* Meeting **data residency** needs by storing data locally.
* They support **internet access** and **AWS Direct Connect**, enabling ultra-fast local communications. ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][2])

### How are Local Zones different from Availability Zones (AZs)?

* **Local Zones** deliver low-latency compute and storage near users but don’t support the full suite of AWS services.
* **AZs**, by contrast, offer the full AWS service range and are built for high availability within Regions. ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][2], [AWS Documentation][3])

### How are Dedicated Local Zones different?

* **Dedicated Local Zones** are private zones exclusively for one customer or organization.
* They bring the benefits of Local Zones plus **custom security and compliance features**, such as access control and monitoring tailored to sensitive workloads. ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][2])

### Local Zones vs. Outposts vs. Wavelength

* **Outposts**: Run AWS infrastructure on-premises for workloads that must remain local, yet integrate fully with AWS cloud.
* **Local Zones**: Serve ultra-low-latency needs without having to manage hardware yourself.
* **Wavelength**: Embeds compute and storage into **5G telco networks** for ultra-low-latency mobile and IoT apps. ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][2])

### How to get started

1. Enable Local Zone for your AWS account.
2. Then, they appear within the console or API.
3. You can manage them just like AZs, using the familiar AWS tools. ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][2])

### Data residency use cases

Yes—they can help meet compliance by storing data in specific geographic zones. Use services like EC2, EBS, FSx, etc., but always verify with your compliance team. ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][2])

### Which instance types are supported?

* Instance offerings vary by zone.
* You can use the **AWS Console** or the `DescribeInstanceTypeOfferings` CLI/API call to discover what's available. ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][2])

## AWS Services & Networking FAQs

### Services available locally

You can use services such as EC2, VPC, EBS, FSx, ELB, EMR, ElastiCache, RDS, and orchestration tools like ECS, EKS, CloudWatch, CloudTrail, and CloudFormation directly in Local Zones. These are seamlessly connected to your parent Region. ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][2])

### How does VPC extension work?

* You extend your VPC into a Local Zone by creating a subnet assigned to that zone.
* It behaves identically to a subnet in an AZ, with automatic routing and firewall configurations. ([AWS Documentation][4])

### EBS volume behavior

* Snapshots from Local Zone EBS volumes—are stored in the **parent Region**.
* Default encryption settings vary by Local Zone:

  * In certain zones (e.g. LA, Miami, etc.), encryption is **not enabled unless default encryption is turned on**.
  * In others, encryption is **enabled by default** with AWS-managed or customer-managed KMS keys. ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][2])

## Pricing & Billing FAQs

### EC2 pricing in Local Zones

Pricing models in Local Zones mirror those in Regions: **On-Demand, Savings Plans, and Spot Instances** are all supported. ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][2])

### Viewing pricing

You can view Local Zone pricing by selecting the specific zone in the AWS pricing tools or console filters. ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][2])

### Tracking costs

Use the **Billing and Cost Management Console**, **Cost Explorer**, or **Cost & Usage Reports** to monitor spend related to Local Zones. ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][2])
