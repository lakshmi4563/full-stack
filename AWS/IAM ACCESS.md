Here’s a clear, exam-ready breakdown of the **“Access management for AWS resources”** section from the AWS IAM User Guide—including its structure, key concepts, and essential details:

---

## Page Structure & Navigation

Within the IAM documentation, this section focuses specifically on **Access Management**, covering:

* **Overview** of how AWS evaluates access requests
* **Authentication and Authorization flow**
* **Policy evaluation logic**
* Links to deeper resources:

  * **How IAM works**
  * **Policies and permissions in AWS Identity and Access Management**
    ([AWS Documentation][1])

---

## Key Content & Concepts

### 1. **What Is Access Management?**

* Access Management within IAM ensures that requests to AWS are properly **authenticated** (verifying identity) and **authorized** (checking permissions).
* You define permissions by creating **policies**—JSON documents that are attached to IAM identities (users, groups, or roles) or AWS resources. These policies dictate who can do what and where.
  ([AWS Documentation][1])

---

### 2. **How Requests Are Evaluated**

When a principal (like an IAM user, role, or federated identity) makes a request:

1. **AWS enforces authentication and authorization** through the enforcement layer.
2. It gathers context from the request—like identity, action, resource, and environment data—and checks applicable policies.
3. **Evaluation logic rules**:

   * There is an **implicit deny** by default—no access unless explicitly allowed.
   * An **Allow** in any identity-based or resource-based policy grants access.
   * **Explicit Deny** (in any policy) overrides any Allow.
   * Additional layers—like **permissions boundaries**, **AWS Organizations Service Control Policies (SCPs)**, or **session policies**—can further restrict access.
     ([AWS Documentation][1])

### 3. **Policy Layers & Impact**

The request context determines which policies apply. Multiple policy types can apply simultaneously—identity-based, resource-based, permissions boundaries, SCPs, session policies, etc. AWS evaluates them in sequence, with explicit denies taking precedence over allows. If any policy denies, the request is blocked.
([AWS Documentation][2])

### 4. **Further Resources**

To dive deeper:

* **How IAM works**: Learn how requests are structured, authentication flows, and more.
* **Policies and permissions**: Understand the different policy types, how to design them, and attachment methods.

| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Access Management**    | Ensures authentication and authorization for AWS resource access                                            |
| **Policy-Based Control** | Permissions are defined via JSON policies attached to identities or resources                               |
| **Evaluation Logic**     | Implicit deny → explicit allow → explicit deny overrides allow; boundaries/SCPs may further restrict access |
| **Key Resources**        | “How IAM works” and “Policies and permissions” for deeper understanding                                     |

### Exam Tips

* **Remember the default**: All actions are implicitly denied unless allowed.
* **Policy evaluation order matters**: Explicit denies override allows.
* **Multiple policy types apply**: Identity-based, resource-based, permissions boundaries, SCPs, and session policies can all affect access.
* **Understand the flow**: Authentication → Authorization → Action.
