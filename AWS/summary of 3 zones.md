1. AWS Regions
These are distinct geographic locations where you deploy AWS resources. AWS operates around 33 Regions globally, and you typically choose the one closest to your users for better performance.

2. Availability Zones (AZs)
Within each Region, there are multiple AZs—physically separated data centers (a few miles apart) designed for high availability and resilience. Deploying across AZs protects against failures affecting a single data center.

3. Local Zones
Think of Local Zones as AZ extensions positioned closer to end users, aimed at reducing latency for compute, storage, and database workloads. You must enable and extend your VPC to them to deploy resources there.

4. Edge Locations
These are globally distributed endpoints used primarily by services like CloudFront (CDN) and Route 53 (DNS) to cache content closer to users. Note: Edge Locations are for caching only—not for deploying your compute or storage resources.

Official AWS Clarifications

Here's how AWS documentation defines each infrastructure layer:

AWS Regions: Isolated geographic areas, each with multiple AZs for fault tolerance.

Availability Zones: Discrete, redundant data centers within Regions—physically separate and interconnected via low-latency fiber for high availability.

Local Zones: Region extensions located near user populations, offering lower-latency access for services like EC2, EBS, and VPC. You must opt in and integrate them via VPC subnets.

Edge Locations: Network caches (points of presence) for acceleration of content delivery and DNS resolution—used by CloudFront, Route 53, Global Accelerator, etc.

Quick Comparison Table
Component	Description	Purpose
Regions	Independent geographic areas with multiple Availability Zones	Global coverage, compliance
Availability Zones	Physical data centers within Regions; isolated yet interconnected	Fault tolerance, resilience
Local Zones	AZ-like extensions closer to specific metro areas	Ultra-low latency compute
Edge Locations	PoPs for caching content and resolving DNS	Faster content delivery
Summary of Balvinder’s Key Points

Regions help you choose deployment locality.

AZs provide redundancy within Regions.

Local Zones reduce latency by placing resources closer to users.

Edge Locations serve as cache nodes, not compute hubs.
