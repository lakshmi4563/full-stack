Here’s a structured, exam-ready summary of the **AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) Introduction** page—complete with key concepts, side-navigation structure, and essential details:

## Page Structure & Sidebar (Implied)

AWS documentation typically organizes the IAM introduction page with the following core sections (and likely sidebar navigation):

1. **What Is IAM?**
2. **Identities**
3. **Access Management**
4. **Service Availability**
5. **Service Cost Information**
6. **Integration with Other AWS Services**

## Main Content Explained

### 1. **What Is IAM?**

* AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a **web service** that enables secure control over who is authenticated (signed in) and authorized (permissions) to access AWS resources.
  ([AWS Documentation][1])
* It provides the infrastructure to manage authentication and authorization across your AWS account.
  ([AWS Documentation][1])

### 2. **Identities**

* Every AWS account starts with a single identity: the **root user**, which has full access to all resources. This user is accessed using the original email and password used to create the account.
  ([AWS Documentation][1])
* **Best practice**: Safeguard root credentials and reserve root access only for tasks that strictly require it.
  ([AWS Documentation][1])
* Use IAM to create other identities—such as administrators, developers, or analysts—and assign appropriate permissions for secure access.
  ([AWS Documentation][1])

### 3. **Access Management**

* Once an IAM user or role is set up, AWS authenticates that principal when they sign in (via console, CLI, or API).
* After authentication, IAM handles authorization—verifying whether the principal’s permissions allow them to access requested resources.
* The authorization process evaluates policies to grant or deny access based on the principal’s assigned permissions.
  ([AWS Documentation][1])
* Once authorized, principals can perform actions such as launching EC2 instances or managing S3 buckets.
  ([AWS Documentation][1])

### 4. **Service Availability**

* IAM is described as **eventually consistent**—changes like user creation and policy updates may take time to propagate across AWS globally.
* **Tip**: Avoid embedding IAM changes in high-availability workflows; instead, treat them as initialization steps, and verify propagation before relying on changes in production.
  ([AWS Documentation][1])

### 5. **Service Cost Information**

* IAM, AWS IAM Identity Center, and AWS Security Token Service (STS) are provided **at no additional charge**.
  ([AWS Documentation][1])
* You incur charges only when using other AWS services via credentials managed by IAM or STS.
* **IAM Access Analyzer’s external access analysis** is free, but charges may apply for unused access analysis and customer policy checks.
  ([AWS Documentation][1])

### 6. **Integration with Other AWS Services**

* IAM is deeply integrated across AWS; nearly every AWS service supports some form of IAM-based access control.
* For details on service-specific IAM support, refer to the “AWS services that work with IAM” section in the full documentation.
  ([AWS Documentation][1])

## Quick Summary Table

| Section                  | Key Takeaways                                                               |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **What Is IAM?**         | Central service for authentication and authorization in AWS                 |
| **Identities**           | Root user (full access); create separate IAM identities for better security |
| **Access Management**    | Authentication → Authorization → Actions; based on policies                 |
| **Service Availability** | Eventual consistency—delay may occur when updating IAM configuration        |
| **Cost Information**     | IAM is free to use; charges apply only for other AWS services via IAM usage |
| **Service Integration**  | IAM works across AWS services for unified permission management             |

### Why It Matters for Exam Prep

* Understand the difference between the **root user** and IAM identities.
* Know IAM’s **authentication and authorization flow**.
* Be aware that IAM is **eventually consistent**—a critical nuance for real-world deployment planning.
* Remember that the IAM service is **free**, but other services will incur charges when accessed via IAM credentials.
