Absolutely—here’s a clean, exam-ready breakdown of the **“Controlling access to AWS resources using policies”** section from the AWS IAM User Guide, including what you'd typically see in the sidebar for easy navigation:

## Page Structure & Sidebar Navigation

This section is organized into key subtopics, which appear as sidebar links for quick reference:

* **Controlling access for principals**
* **Controlling access to identities**
* **Controlling access to policies**
* **Controlling access to resources**
* **Controlling access to principals in a specific account**
  ([AWS Documentation][1])

## Key Concepts & Breakdown

### 1. **Controlling Access with Policies**

* Policies—written in JSON—define who can perform what action on which resources under certain conditions.
* When a request is made, AWS examines the **context** (action, principal, resource, and other metadata) and evaluates all applicable policies to determine if the action is authorized.
  ([AWS Documentation][2])

---

### 2. **Controlling Access for Principals**

* Identity-based policies determine what actions a **principal** (user, group, or role) can perform.
* You can also use **permissions boundaries**, which are upper limits on what permissions identity-based policies can grant. They never grant permissions themselves but restrict the maximum privileges.
  ([AWS Documentation][2])

---

### 3. **Controlling Access to Identities**

* You can set policies that restrict who can manage IAM identities—like users, groups, or roles.
* Example: Allow users to manage credentials for their own accounts but prevent changes to broader identity objects unless criteria are met.
  ([AWS Documentation][2])

---

### 4. **Controlling Access to Policies**

* Policies themselves are objects you can control—who can **create, modify, attach, or detach** policies.
* This is helpful to prevent misuse or overly permissive policies.
  ([AWS Documentation][2])

---

### 5. **Controlling Access to Resources**

* Use either **identity-based policies** (attach to user/role) or **resource-based policies** (attach to the resource itself, e.g., S3 bucket policy).
* *Important:* Creating a resource doesn’t automatically give the creator ownership permissions—most actions must be explicitly allowed.
  ([AWS Documentation][2])

---

### 6. **Controlling Access for Principals in Specific Accounts**

* You can grant access to principals in the same AWS account via IAM policies.
* For cross-account access, the principal in **Account A** needs permissions, and the resource in **Account B** must have a resource-based policy granting that access.
* Roles are often used for cross-account access; alternatively, resource-based policies handle access grants selectively.
  ([AWS Documentation][2], [Stack Overflow][3])

## Summary Table

| Access Control Context   | Description                                                                    |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Principals**           | What users, groups, or roles are allowed to perform (identity-based).          |
| **Identities**           | Who can manage IAM identities (users, roles, groups).                          |
| **Policies**             | Control who can create, edit, attach, or detach policies.                      |
| **Resources**            | Define who can interact with specific resources (identity- or resource-based). |
| **Cross-Account Access** | Grant access across AWS accounts using roles or resource-based policies.       |

## Exam Tips

1. **Understand policy types** — identity-based, resource-based, permissions boundaries.
2. Know that **creating a resource doesn’t auto-grant permissions**.
3. **Permissions boundaries don’t grant—they restrict maximum permissions.**
4. **Cross-account access** always requires permissions in both the requester and resource accounts.
