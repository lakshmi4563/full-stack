**1. Prerequisites**

You need:

An AWS account

IAM credentials (not your root account)

Itâ€™s best practice to create an IAM user with least privilege accessâ€”only the permissions needed for your tasks 
AWS Documentation
.

**2. How to Access or Install the AWS CLI**

AWS provides multiple ways to install or access the AWS CLI v2:

Recommended: Install or update to the latest version of AWS CLI v2 
AWS Documentation
.

Install past releases if your workflow depends on a particular version 
AWS Documentation
.

Build from source using the GitHub repositoryâ€”useful if you need to support platforms not covered by official installers 
AWS Documentation
.

Run via Dockerâ€”you can use Amazon ECR Public or AWS-provided Docker images 
AWS Documentation
.

Use AWS CloudShell, the browser-based terminal in the AWS Consoleâ€”no installation needed

.

3. Configure AWS CLI for First-Time Use**

Once installed or accessed:

You must configure the AWS CLI with your IAM credentials (access key, secret key, region, output format, or SSO settings) for the first time you use it

Q1. The AWS CLI is primarily used for:

Answer:
ðŸ‘‰ To manage AWS services from the command line using scripts or commands.

It provides programmatic access to AWS services.

Developers and administrators use it for automation (instead of clicking in the AWS Console).

Correct Option (if MCQ):
âœ… Managing AWS services and automating tasks from the command line.

Q2. A new developer joins your team. You want them to use the AWS CLI for programmatic access but not the root account. What steps will you take in IAM to provide secure access?

Steps to follow (exam-ready explanation):

Never use the Root Account â†’ Root is only for account setup/billing.

Create a new IAM User:

Go to IAM service â†’ Users â†’ Add user.

Give them programmatic access (Access Key ID & Secret Key).

Assign Permissions via IAM Policies:

Attach least-privilege policies (e.g., AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess if they only need S3).

Or, add them to an IAM Group with the right permissions.

Enable MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) for added security.

Share credentials securely:

Provide the Access Key + Secret Key to the developer.

Ask them to run aws configure in CLI and enter:

Access Key ID

Secret Access Key

Default Region

Output format (e.g., json)

Summary Answer (for exams):
ðŸ‘‰ Create an IAM user (not root), grant least-privilege permissions via IAM policies, enable MFA, and provide programmatic access keys for AWS CLI configuratio



SUMMARY
What is AWS CLI?

The AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) is a unified tool to manage AWS services.

Instead of using the AWS Management Console (web-based UI), you can run commands in your terminal or command prompt.

It allows both scripting and automation of AWS tasks.

ðŸ”¹ Key Features

Cross-platform â€“ Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Unified tool â€“ One tool to manage multiple AWS services.

Automation support â€“ You can create shell scripts or batch files to automate tasks.

Consistent syntax â€“ Uses commands like:



The AWS CLI is a powerful tool that lets you control AWS services from the terminal. Itâ€™s faster than the console for repetitive tasks, supports scripting & automation, and is essential for developers, DevOps engineers, and cloud administrators.
