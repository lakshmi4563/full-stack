Here’s a clear, structured, and exam-ready breakdown of the **"Create a role to delegate permissions to an AWS service"** page from the AWS IAM documentation, including the main content, relevant sidebar items, and the exact steps involved.

## Page Structure & Sidebar Overview

This IAM documentation page is organized into key sections, which are typically listed in the sidebar for easy navigation:

* **Service role permissions**
* **Creating a role for an AWS service (console)**
* **Creating a role for a service (AWS CLI)**
* **Creating a role for a service (AWS API)**
  ([AWS Documentation][1])

## Key Concepts: What Is a Service Role?

* A **Service Role** is an IAM role that an AWS service assumes to perform actions on your behalf.
* A specialized variant, known as a **Service-Linked Role**, is specifically tied to a service and includes predefined permissions and trust policies.
  ([AWS Documentation][1])

## How to Create a Service Role via the AWS Console

Step-by-step process:

1. Sign in to the **AWS Management Console** and open the **IAM console**.
2. In the navigation pane, click **Roles**, then **Create role**.
3. Under **Trusted entity type**, choose **AWS service**.
4. Select the specific **service** and its **use case**—these determine the required trust policy.
5. Click **Next**.
6. In **Permissions policies**, options vary based on the service:

   * You might not be able to select policies if they're predefined by the service.
   * You may choose from a limited or broader list.
   * Or you can add policies later.
7. *(Optional)* Set a **permissions boundary**, which restricts the maximum permissions this role can have.
8. Click **Next**.
9. **Role Name**: Depending on the service:

   * You might not be able to edit it (if defined by the service).
   * You may add a suffix to a fixed prefix.
   * Or provide a full custom name yourself.
   * Role names must be unique (case-insensitive) and cannot be changed after creation.
10. *(Optional)* Add a **Description** for clarity.
11. *(Optional)* Use **Edit** to revise trusted entities or permissions if needed.
12. *(Optional)* Add **Tags** (key-value pairs) to help organize or search for the role.
13. Review all settings and click **Create role**.

## How to Create a Service Role via AWS CLI

The CLI process involves explicitly carrying out each step:

1. **Create the role with a trust policy**:

   ```bash
   aws iam create-role \
     --role-name Test-Role \
     --assume-role-policy-document file://Test-Role-Trust-Policy.json
   ```
2. **Attach managed permissions policy** (or use an inline one):

   ```bash
   aws iam attach-role-policy \
     --role-name Test-Role \
     --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/ReadOnlyAccess
   ```

   Or for inline policy:

   ```bash
   aws iam put-role-policy \
     --role-name Test-Role \
     --policy-name ExamplePolicy \
     --policy-document file://AdminPolicy.json
   ```
3. *(Optional)* **Tag the role**:

   ```bash
   aws iam tag-role --role-name Test-Role --tags Key=Department,Value=Finance
   ```
4. *(Optional)* **Set a permissions boundary**:

   ```bash
   aws iam put-role-permissions-boundary \
     --role-name Test-Role \
     --permissions-boundary arn:aws:iam::123456789012:policy/BoundaryPolicy
   ```

## Why This Matters in the Real World & Exams

* **Service roles** allow AWS services to securely act on your behalf—without using the root user or embedding credentials.
* **Service-linked roles** simplify setup by embedding predefined trust policies.
* **Permissions boundaries** provide flexible security control—especially useful in principle-of-least-privilege setups.
* **Uniqueness and immutability of role names** ensures consistent references and security configurations.
* Understanding both **console and CLI creation flows** is essential for automation, DevOps practices, and exam readiness.

## Quick Reference Table

| Method      | Steps Included in Flow                                                        |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Console** | Choose trusted entity → select use case → attach policies → name/tag → create |
| **CLI**     | `create-role` → attach policy → optional: tag, boundary                       |
